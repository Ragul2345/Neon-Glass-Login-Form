Neon Glass Login Form :
                      The Neon Glass Login Form is a front-end project designed to demonstrate how modern web design principles like glassmorphism and neon glow effects
                      can be applied to a simple user interface â€” a login screen.
                      
This project demonstrates how to build a modern, visually appealing Login Form using only: 
                      HTML (structure)
                      CSS (design, layout, and effects) and 
                      JavaScript (behavior and validation)

It uses two trending UI styles:
                      Neon Glow (bright glowing effects)
                      Glassmorphism (frosted-glass look using blur and transparency)
